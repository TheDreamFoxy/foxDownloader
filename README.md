# FoxDownloader
- A small tool to bulk download from URL list
- It's made in vanilla JS so you don't need to install anything from NPM

# Usage
- It's easy, in `list.txt` enter or paste the URLs with files you want to download (I've added some as example)
- Then just run `downloader.js` with Node and it should start to download. Really simple.

# Tools
- `txt21.js` is for creating one text file from more text files, create a folder (currently called `urls` but you can change it in the code easily) where you have more text files that you want to merge to one. Then simply run it with Node.
